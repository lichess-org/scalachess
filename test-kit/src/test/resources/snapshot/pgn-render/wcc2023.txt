[Opening "Ruy Lopez: Closed, Delayed Exchange"]

{ The initial game of a World Championship match is always a bit specific. Both players have come there very well prepared, but they know little about the opponent's preparation. Is the opponent willing to enter a theoretical debate, repeating the same openings again or again, or is he going to vary them, coming with many surprising lines for one or two games? In the initial games
the players are also trying to learn as much as possible about the opponent's preparation, while trying not to reveal much about their own. It makes sense to surprise the opponent, but one should not take too many risks, as a loss in a relatively short match might cause a player big problems. }
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 { Contrary to many other top players, Ding Liren mostly plays 3...a6, although he sometimes plays Berlin, too. Ian Nepomniachtchi has undoubtedly prepared some dangerous ideas against it. } 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Bxc6 { This move probably came as a surprise. As far as I know, Ian
Nepomniachtchi had not played this move before. White steers the game into a less explored position with some imbalances. Black's doubled pawn is not much of a problem. On the other hand, his bishop pair is not so strong so far. Why
White did not take on c6 already on move 4? Black's e5-pawn might hang in many lines, and Black will need to spend the extra tempo on protecting it. Objectively speaking, White has no advantage here, but it is the case with most topical lines nowadays. The element of surprise can be quite important, as Ian Nepomniachtchi has surely studied the resulting positions deeper. } (6. Re1 { and }) (6. d3 { are much more popular and have also been played by Ian Nepomniachtchi many times. }) 6... dxc6 7.

sides, primarily for the one which had not expected this line. }) 9... Nxg4 (9... Bg6 10. Nxe5 { also deserves a deeper analysis, Black has various option
there. }) 10. hxg4 Bxg4 { looks fine for Black, but it is mostly a good idea to avoid the sharpest lines when a well-prepared opponent surprises you. And there is no doubt that both players came very well prepared! A very sharp position with mutual chances could arise after } 11. d4!? exd4 12. Qd3 c5 13. Nbd2 Qd6 14. c3 { . }) 8. d4!? { White opens the position, postponing his queenside development for the time being. After } (8.

Bd6?! { is less good in view of } 9. Nbd2! exd4 10. Nc4!? $14 { or } (10. Nxd4 { , as Black's bishop on d6 becomes a target.

Bxd8 { leads to an endgame which is good for Black. White's pawn
majority is not very relevant with so many pieces on the board, he would need to exchange the dark-squared bishops and rooks to make his kingside majority count. Without losing his queenside pawns, of course. As it is, Black can just develop the pieces and achieve a good position. }) 11... Bg4?! { This move might be inaccurate. It is not so easy to handle an unfamiliar position over the board. After } (11... Ne6! 12. Bg3 { Black has many reasonable moves leading to approximate equality. Personally I like } (12. Nc3?!

fact, the c6-pawn protects the d5-square. }) 12... Qd7 { While } (12... Bd6?! 13. Bxd6 cxd6 { would have undoubled Black's pawns, the d6-pawn would remain weak.

Nc3 { Ian Nepomniachtchi played very quickly until now, but spent 24 minutes on this move. Either he was already on his own, or he had forgotten the details of his preparation.

commentary, namely } (13. h3! Rad8 14. Nc3! Qxd4? (14... Bf6 15. Nf3 Bxf3 16. Qxc5! b6 17. Qf5 Qxf5 18. exf5 Bxc3 19. bxc3 Bd5 20. Bxc7 $16 { also

two good replies: } 16... Bd6 (16... Bf8!? 17. Qg3 g6 18. Bxc7 Qd2!? $44 { is risky

White has a slight edge due to his better pawn structure and a more active bishop. He can play for a win without any risk, which is an ideal scenario in a World Championship match. } 17... f6 { Black had to move his f-pawn sooner or later to bring his bishop back into play. That said, such a move also weakens his king a bit. It is not relevant now, but could matter later on. } 18. h3 h6 19. Kh2 { White improves his position little by little. There is no need to hurry, as Black cannot improve his position much, either. } 19... Bf7 20. Rad1 b6 { This is a logical move. The position resembles the Berlin defense, but in our game the pawn formation a5-b6-c5-c7 is more vulnerable, as a loss of the c7-pawn could cost Black another pawn and a game. In Berlin endgames such a danger hardly exists with Black's king on the queenside, and even with Black's king on the kingside White mostly needs to sacrifice a pawn (e5-e6) to win the c7-pawn and perhaps another one. In contrast, in our game the bishop on g3 already eyes c7. After } (20... Rxd1 21. Rxd1 (21. Nxd1!? $14) 21... Rd8 { White could try } 22. Qa7!? { , a move which is no longer possible after 20...b6.

If White managed to win the c6-pawn, create a passed pawn on f6 and then push b2-b4 to be able to play a3-a4 after Black takes en passant a4xb3, he could generate real winning chances.

Ding Liren has consolidated his position. } 41. Bc7 (41. e6?! Bxe6!) 41... Nc5 { Black temporarily gives a pawn. He must have been happy to activate the knight which had largely been performing defensive tasks until now. } 42. Bxa5 Kf7 43. Bb4 Nd3 44. e6+ Bxe6 45. Nxc6 Bd7 46. Nd4 Nxb2 $10 { The position is dead equal now, as a knight swap almost invariably leads to a simple draw. } 47. Kf3 Nd3 48. g3 Nc1 { The knight heads for b3, trying to exchange White's centralized knight. } 49. Ke3 Nb3 { An interesting strategic game. It contained no fireworks, but we have seen a high-level fighting game, not a boring theoretical draw. Ian Nepomniachtchi achieved to receive a fresh position and build up an advantage with strong play, but Black's position remained hard to crack even after some inaccuracies. Starting from move 27, Ding Liren demonstrated a high-level defense and made a draw. With the current level of preparation and play, it is very hard to win a classical game against a top player who acts solidly. That said, I am sure that we will see such games soon. (I swear that I had written this before the start of game 2!) } 1/2-1/2

itself cannot surprise the opponent. } 1... Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 { The Russian
grandmaster played this move rarely, mostly in speed games played until 2021.

in his last classical tournament before the match. } (3. Nf3 { was a bit more
common move in Ian's games, although he also used it mostly in speed games. }) 3... d5 (3... Bb4 { is the most common move on a top level. Ding Liren also
mostly chooses it, but Ian Nepomniachtchi has surely prepared something there. }) 4. cxd5 exd5 5. Bg5 c6 6. e3 { The Carlsbad structure is strategically very
complex, as both sides have a multitude of plans. The resulting positions
mostly require good understanding rather then a precise calculation or
imagination. White has slightly easier play, but Black has a solid position.
Carlsbad ("Karlsbad" in German, "Karlovy Vary" in Czech, "Карловы
Вары" in Russian) is a lovely Czech spa town near the border with Germany,
very popular among Russians. Even the legendary chess trainer and writer Mark
Dvoretsky was travelling there often. } 6... h6 { This push had been considered
inaccurate until recently, but has become very popular during the last 10
years. Black can no longer transfer his knight to g6, but it has turned out
that a bishop exchange leads to a satisfactory position. } 7. Bh4 Be7 8. Bd3 O-O 9. Qc2 Re8 10. Nge2 Nbd7 11. O-O (11. O-O-O? { is too optimistic, as Black's

square on e3 and a weak central pawn. Black cannot invade there immediately

f4. }) 18... a5 { Black will exchange the bishops on a6 with good play. His
knight could then be transferred to c4. }) 11... a5 { Black makes a useful move.

later. } (11... Nh5 12. Bxe7 Qxe7 { leads to a typical position which might be

weakening of the c5-square here, as his knights cannot get there easily. }) 13. Bxe7 Qxe7 14. Rae1 { It often makes sense to play for e3-e4 once Black has
played a7-a5, as the typical push c6-c5 has become problematic because of the

Black a slight pull due to disorganized White's pieces, but not more. }) 29. Nb5 Nc7 30. Nd4 Ne6 { Ding Liren has recovered from the previous loss and played a
good game. He equalized easily and even had slight initiative towards the end.
On the other hand, White was never in real danger. The game was relatively
short, with most of the action remaining behind the curtains. Ian
Nepomniachtchi maintains the lead, while Ding Liren needs only one win to
level the score. } 1/2-1/2
